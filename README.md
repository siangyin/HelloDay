# React-Project 2 : Focus Diary

[Demo Link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##  Pre-Project Planning



### Problem

Even on a good day, life can be overwhelming. Buzzing phones, work obligations, family needs, to-do lists, email overload, expectations, illness, invitations and the list goes on for the things that occupy our time. On top of that we have food choices, clothing choices, money worries, and mental and physical health issues that can weigh us down.

Personally, I always get stressed out pretty easily and having alot of inner thought in mind fighting with each other. Some day, I feel energetic and positive but some other day I maybe feeling down and begin to self doubting.  By jot down all the thoughts reminding myself are helpful to free the mind and can be like a walk through or reflections from things that happened around me. 

### Solution

Focus Diaries as like a place where one can record events, experience and even throw anything you want to declutter out from your mind. This digital journal app help to simplfy your life by empty what's on your mind at the same time understand ownself better.

## Project Development

### User Story

A user should be able to login to the main application area to:
- create new diary input
- access to all his/her diaries for 
 - viewing
 - editing
 - deleting



### Ideas & App Structures:
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
